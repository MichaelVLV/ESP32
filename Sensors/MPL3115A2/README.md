# MPL3115A2 pressure sensor

 
* This example is not finished yet. Tested response only for WHO_I_AM register.
But i2c read/write functions works according to datasheet.
* output_data_arduino.txt contains reference sensors readings (actually, my sensor is damaged a bit, so values is much higher than it should be - normal pressure is about 101.3 kPa)
